# Plex script, meant for use in combination with Tautulli.

This script is meant in combination with Tautulli. [Tautulli](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli) (formerly known as PlexPy) is a monitoring program built specially for Plex Media Server.

Here's a step by step guide to adding the script to Tautulli, and editing it to make it work for you.

#### Before we start:

For this to work, you'll need to follow the steps on the [Homepage](https://github.com/matmuilwijk/Scripts) of this repository. Without these steps, the script won't work!

#### In your filemanager:

1. Download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matmuilwijk/Scripts/master/plex/tradfri.plex.sh), or clone this repository.
2. Open the script `tradfri.plex.sh`
3. Enter the username you created behind `user=`
4. Enter the Preshared-Key behind `psk=`
5. Enter the IP-adress of your gateway behind `ip=`


#### In Tautulli:

1. Go to `Tautulli settings`
2. Go to `Notification Agents`
3. Click `Add a new notification agent`
4. Scroll down, and select `Script`.

In Tautulli settings, go to 'Notification Agents', and click 'Add a new notification agent'.

Scroll down, and select 'Script'.
