# Scripts
Hi, welcome to my Tradfri-scripts repo.

In this repo you'll find (eventually) several scripts to control your Ikea Tradfri bulbs from a linux computer and/or server.

For these scripts to work, you'll need Libcoap installed. You could either install it yourself, or run the script in the repo.
	1. Download the installcoap.sh script from this repo.
	2. Chmod the file to run it. (sudo chmod +x installcoap.sh)
	3. Run the file as root. (sudo sh installcoap.sh)

All of these scripts need a username and pre-shared key to work.
