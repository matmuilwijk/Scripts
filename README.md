# Scripts
Hi, welcome to my Tradfri-scripts repo.

In this repo you'll find (eventually) several scripts to control your Ikea Tradfri bulbs from a computer and/or server.

The first script you'll find is one I've created for Tautulli. It provides a service that switches/dims the lights whenever a movie or
TV-show is started on a Plex Media Server.
